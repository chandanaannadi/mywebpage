      The environment is defined as the surroundings of a physical system that may interact with other systems by exchanging mass and energy. All the living beings and the non-living things fall under natural environment. The environment is the surrounding that we live in, and so it is our responsibility to protect it from any destruction. Environmental pollution is one of the greatest problems that human society is facing today. Air, water, and soil form the three basic areas of environmental pollution.All living and nonliving things are included in the natural environment. Because the environment is the setting in which we live, it is our responsibility to keep it safe from harm. Environmental pollution is one of the most serious issues confronting human society today.

    Water Pollution:<br>
    A practical definition of water pollution is: "Water pollution is the addition of substances or energy forms that directly or indirectly alter the nature of the water body in such a manner that negatively affects its legitimate uses".[1]: 6  Therefore, pollution is associated with concepts attributed to humans, namely the negative alterations and the uses of the water body. Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic contaminants.

      Noise Pollution:<br>
      Noise pollution impacts millions of people on a daily basis. The most common health problem it causes is Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Exposure to loud noise can also cause high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. These health problems can affect all age groups, especially children. Many children who live near noisy airports or streets have been found to suffer from stress and other problems, such as impairments in memory, attention level, and reading skill.

        Air Pollution:<br>
        Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.
